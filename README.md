# weatherStation
Wireless weather station that collects data locally on the device you are connected to it with. 

Arduino for all the sensors and ESP8266 to broadcast the information.

With only few sensors you wouldn't need the Arduino, but with this many you do. Power distribution wasn't enough on HUZZAH or NodeMCU for all of these.
